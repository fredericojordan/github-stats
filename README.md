# github-stats
Python scripts to gather github statistics.

## Requirements

In order to run the scripts, we need to install dependecies and list the usernames we'll be analysing.

### Installing dependencies

Run the following command on your terminal:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### The usernames file

We also need a `usernames.txt` text file listing github usernames we are interested in gathering statistics from.

For example:

```
fredericojordan
```

## Running the scripts

Simply run the script from your terminal:

```sh
python stats.py
```
